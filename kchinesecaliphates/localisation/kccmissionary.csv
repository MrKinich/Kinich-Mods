While pondering the best way to spread the worship of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] among the [offmap_china.GetShortName], several remarked that they were inspired to take up the mantle of [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] by displays of intense devotion- perhaps a similar display would work here?

The [offmap_china.Ruler.Religion.GetName] [offmap_china.Ruler.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s have blamed the storm on my pious [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s!

EVTDESC_kccmission.0019;I received a letter from my [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s in the middle kingdom today. They had spent a few days preaching in a village near a garrison, and the officer in charge of the fort had heard of them & wished to meet with these strange & exotic outsiders.

EVTDESC_kccmission.0020;I received a letter from my [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s in the middle kingdom today. They were passing through a town near the [offmap_china.GetName]'s coast when a group of traditionalist scholars intercepted them.  These learned men demanded to know how these foreigners could dare to spread their impure, alien ideas within the [offmap_china.GetName]'s borders. The lead [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] responded...;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_kccmission.0020a;"The [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is but a natural extension of your own";FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_kccmission.0021;I received a letter from my [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s in the middle kingdom today. They had encountered a traveler from the faraway land of [KCCGetPilgrimHomeland] on the road between two [offmap_china.GetName] towns.

EVTDESC_kccmission.0022a;At last! The [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s I sent into the [offmap_china.GetName] have returned! They experienced many weird & wonderful adventures in their quest to spread the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and bring the middle kingdom into [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]'s embrace, and their efforts have borne fruit- communities of [Root.Religion.GetName]s have sprung up where none existed before, and the [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] are that much closer to the truth!;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_kccmission.0022b;Woe is me! My [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s have returned from the [offmap_china.GetName] with disheartening news! Despite their best efforts, they have not managed to win many converts to the [Root.Religion.GetName] way, and what little successes they did find are even now slipping back into their [offmap_china.Ruler.Religion.GetName] ways.
