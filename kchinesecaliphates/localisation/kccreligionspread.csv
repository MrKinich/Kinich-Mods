EVTDESC_kccspread.0002;A new religion is spreading in China! Great numbers of [From.Religion.GetGroupName] traders have been entering China for some time now, & the [offmap_china.GetShortName] have been increasingly exposed to [From.Religion.GetFullName] ideas. The [From.Religion.GetFullName] community is still small, but [offmap_china.GetShortName] translations of [From.Religion.GetScriptureName] are already appearing. Who knows, perhaps one day the [From.Religion.GetFullName] faithful will be a potent force in the [offmap_china.GetShortName] community?;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

As part of [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] ongoing quest to pacify the people of the [offmap_china.GetName], [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSheHe] has been working to spread the [offmap_china.Ruler.Religion.GetName] faith among the people of the middle kingdom, and [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] efforts have begun to bear fruit. The [offmap_china.Ruler.Religion.GetName] community is but a small minority, but they are growing in influence & numbers both.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_kccspread.0003b;The [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] community has been a small force in the background of [offmap_china.GetName] society for some time now, unimportant & irrelevant, but perhaps that is soon to change. Their numbers are growing, and while they are still but one minority religion in the vast [offmap_china.GetName], they appear to be on the rise. Will this trend continue? Who can say, but for now, things are looking up for the [offmap_china.GetShortName] [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] faithful.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

The [offmap_china.Ruler.Religion.GetName] community is now a sizeable minority, with a noticeable impact on [offmap_china.GetName] society.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_kccspread.0004b;The [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] community has been a minor force in the background of [offmap_china.GetName] society for some time now, but that is changing. Their growth continues, and while they are still but just a minority, they are no longer an ignorable one. Will this trend continue? Who can say, but for now, things are looking up for the [offmap_china.GetShortName] [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] faithful.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_kccspread.0005a;The [offmap_china.GetShortName] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle], [offmap_china.Ruler.GetDynName], only has common faith with a fraction of [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] subjects. As part of [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] ongoing quest to pacify the people of the [offmap_china.GetName], [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSheHe] has been working to spread the [offmap_china.Ruler.Religion.GetName] faith among the people of the middle kingdom, and [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] efforts have borne fruit both bountiful & exquisite. The [offmap_china.Ruler.Religion.GetName] community is not quite a majority, but they are ubiquitous- [offmap_china.Ruler.Religion.GetName] temples exist in every town & village, and the [offmap_china.Ruler.Religion.GetName] community shall surely thrive in the middle kingdom long after the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty has fallen.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_kccspread.0005b;The [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] community can no longer be called a mere a minor force in the background of [offmap_china.GetName] society. [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] temples exist in every town & village, [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] clergy are a common sight in all but the smallest settlements, and pious [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion]s can be found at all levels of [offmap_china.GetName] society. Will their rise to power provoke a backlash from the [offmap_china.Ruler.Religion.GetName] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetDynName]?

EVTDESC_kccspread.0006a;The [offmap_china.GetShortName] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle], [offmap_china.Ruler.GetDynName], finally shares the faith of the vast majority of [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] subjects. For decades, [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSheHe] has been working to spread the [offmap_china.Ruler.Religion.GetName] faith among the people of the middle kingdom, and [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSheHe] has succeeded beyond [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] wildest dreams. The [offmap_china.GetName] is now firmly a [offmap_china.Ruler.Religion.GetName] realm and will likely be ruled by a long succession of pious [offmap_china.Ruler.Religion.GetName] dynasties.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_kccspread.0006b;When the [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] faith first entered the middle kingdom, few could have predicted their meteoric rise to power. The [offmap_china.GetShortName] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle] trembles in [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] palace, as the [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] faith has spread completely out of [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] control. There are whispers that [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSheHe] will soon be forced to convert if [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSheHe] wishes to maintain [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] hold on the Dragon Throne. The Middle Kingdom will surely be a center- if not *the* center- of the [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] world for centuries to come.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

Despite fierce opposition from the old [KCCGetBadWaxWaneReligion] clergy, the [offmap_china.GetName] is now firmly a [offmap_china.Ruler.Religion.GetName] realm- they will still have to deal with the [KCCGetBadWaxWaneReligion] minority, though. Perhaps one day, the [KCCGetBadWaxWaneReligion]s will seize power again, but that is not this day.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

The old [KCCGetBadWaxWaneReligion] majority has no intention of going quietly into the night, however- perhaps this signals the start of a new era of religious conflict in the [offmap_china.GetName]?;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_kccspread.0007;No [offmap_china.GetName], no! How could you turn your back on [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] like this?.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_kccspread.0008;Once the [offmap_china.GetName] was a shining center of the [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] world, but it seems those days are in the past. The [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] faith is by no means a minority, but it seems that it does not appeal to the [offmap_china.GetShortName] people the way it once did. For years, both local folk religions & more organized faiths like Taoism have been gaining in popularity, and now the majority status enjoyed by [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion]s has finally vanished. Whether this is but a temporary setback or the start of a longer decline is impossible to say.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_kccspread.0008a;Surely the [offmap_china.GetShortName] people will realize their error before too long...;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_kccspread.0009;Once the [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] faith was a major force in [offmap_china.GetName] politics, but it seems those days are no more. [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] temples used to exists in every city, and [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] clergy were a common site throughout the middle kingdom, but lately those temples have been empty more often than not, & the local clergy are serving ever smaller congregations. Zealous [offmap_china.GetShortName] [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion]s argue that this decline in influence is temporary at best, but few tend to find their views persuasive.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_kccspread.0010;The [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] minority in the [offmap_china.GetName] has gotten smaller still. Perhaps [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] families are having less children, perhaps [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] doctrine is not as appealing as it once was, or maybe [offmap_china.GetShortName] [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion]s are simply leaving the middle kingdom for greener pastures. Whatever the reason, the effects are clear- the [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] community, already small, has shrunk to near irrelevancy.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_kccspread.0011;There was no single turning point for the fate of [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion]s in the middle kingdom- no grand persecution, no forced expulsions or demands for conversion. Not in living memory, at least. Perhaps if there were, the current situation would be easier for the rest of the [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] world to swallow, for the last major [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] communities in the middle kingdom- if any [offmap_china.GetShortName] [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] communities could even be called major- have disintegrated. There may still be individual [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion]s in the middle kingdom, stubbornly clinging to their irrelevant religion, but for all intents & purposes the [KCCGetGoodWaxWaneReligion] faith is extinct in the [offmap_china.GetName].;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
